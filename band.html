<p>Guns N’ Roses was formed in Los Angeles in 1985 by Rose and Stradlin. After changes in personnel, the band’s lineup stabilized with Rose as the vocalist, McKagan on bass, Adler on drums, and Slash and Stradlin on guitar. Signing with Geffen Records, they released the extended-play recording Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide in 1986, followed by the landmark album Appetite for Destruction in 1987. The music’s sizzling fury, with Rose’s wildcat howls matched by Slash’s guitar pyrotechnics, made the album a smash hit, with sales of more than 17 million.</p>

        <h3>Slash and Steven Adler Join Hollywood Rose</h3>
        <p>Hollywood Rose was an early band in the Guns N' Roses story. The group was formed in 1983 by guitarist Chris Weber,
          Izzy Stradlin and Axl Rose. Along with several revolving bass players and drummer Johnny Kreis, the band recorded a few
          demos together and played some smaller shows. Internal problems led to Road Crew's Slash and Steven Adler coming in
          on the guitar and drums, respectively. Though Stradlin left for a bit, the introduction of Rose and Slash ultimately
          determined what would become Guns N' Roses' future.</p>

        <h3>Guns N' Roses Form</h3>
        <p>Hollywood Rose eventually dissolved, and Los Angeles guitarist Tracii Guns was looking for a vocalist for his band L.A. Guns.
          Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin joined him in 1985, and they went on to combine their names to become Guns N' Roses. Duff McKagan, who
          had recently played in Road Crew, was hired on bass.They called up Slash and Adler, whom they'd previously played with in Hollywood
          Rose and Road Crew, and the official lineup was finally complete. "The moment that we fuckin' slammed into our first chord, there was
          something. And we all knew it," McKagan later recalled, adding that Rose was the final element to click the second he started singing.</p>

        <h3>Guns N' Roses Sign to Geffen Records</h3>
        <p>Tom Zutaut, was working for Geffen Records at the time and had been invited to one of GN'R's February shows at the Troubadour in 1986.
          After hearing a few songs in their set, he went back outside and advised the other label reps that the band wasn't good or worth taking on.
          On March 26, 1986, Guns N' Roses signed a "memo deal" with Geffen Records and received an advance of $75,000.</p>

      <p>Despite what we know today about the album, Appetite for Destruction didn't do all that well in its first year."Welcome to the Jungle" was released
        as the first single that October, and David Geffen had to personally call MTV and ask them to play the accompanying music video.</p>

      <h3>An Unforgettable Night in St. Louis</h3>
      <p>The infamous Riverport Riot was already brewing before the show even started.During “Rocket Queen,” the singer ordered guards to confiscate a camera
        from a member of the audience. When they didn’t comply, he took matters into his own hands — diving face-first off the stage and into the crowd. Once he
        climbed back onto the stage, he signaled the rest of the band to stop playing and announced he would be going home, smashing his microphone on the floor
        as he walked off. Confused fans started rioting, and Rose was later arrested for the occurrence.</p>
